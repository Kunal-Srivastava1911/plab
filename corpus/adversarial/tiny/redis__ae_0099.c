/* Process every pending file event, then every pending time event
 * (that may be registered by file event callbacks just processed).
 * Without special flags the function sleeps until some file event
 * fires, or when the next time event occurs (if any).
 *
 * If flags is 0, the function does nothing and returns.
 * if flags has AE_ALL_EVENTS set, all the kind of events are processed.
 * if flags has AE_FILE_EVENTS set, file events are processed.
 * if flags has AE_TIME_EVENTS set, time events are processed.
 * if flags has AE_DONT_WAIT set, the function returns ASAP once all
 * the events that can be handled without a wait are processed.
 * if flags has AE_CALL_AFTER_SLEEP set, the aftersleep callback is called.
